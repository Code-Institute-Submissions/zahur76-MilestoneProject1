**VISIT MAURITIUS**

The project was created with the main intention to promote tourism in Mauritius. 
Tourism being one of the main pillars of the Mauritian economy, my design was geared towards a website
that would reach a wide audience and show them many sides of tourism that Mauritius can offer. 


**UX**

The website is mainly for those who are looking for a holiday destination.
By visiting this site the users should be able to get a overview to what Mauritius can offer as a travel destination
in a user friendly manner.
It should also be able to showcase other aspects of tourism besides beaches.
The user should be able to identify main reasons to visit Mauritius.
The user should be able to identify whether Mauritius would meet their travel criteria, such as:
- is the destinaton family friendly?
- actvities on offer
- cultural aspects

The site layout was contructed using wireframe below find link [here](linkhttps://github.com/zahur76/MilestoneProject1/blob/master/wireframe.pdf)


**FEATURES**

All pages consist of the same header and footer layout. The header consists of collapse menu 
for smaller devices which links to the other pages.
The footer has social links to plus an addtional link where visitors can download pdf form
on how to become a resident.

*Home page*

The main landing page consists of a hero image showcasing the natural beauty of Mauriitus.
The page also highlights 3 main reasons to visit Mauritius using images a text. The user can then link to 
experiences page to further explore activities in more detail.

*Experiences page*

This page has a layout of 9 main activities which can be done in Mauritius covering activities 
for all demographics. Images and text for the activities.


*Mauritius page*

A description of Mauritius for those wanting to gain more knowledge of Mauritius. Description 
taken from wikepedia.

*Contact page*

This page is used if the user wants any further imformation by filling a contact form.

*Another feature idea*

In the future would like to add a weather widget to main hero image.

The following languages were used: 
*HTML
*CSS 
*CSS and HTML Validation by W3C
*chrome dev tools
Bootstrap 4 was used to for page layout purposes to help in responsive design.

**TESTING**

1. Layout
The site has been tested to see if all content implemented meets the website initial goals. Several layout and image content 
were tested before finalising web pages.
During testing it was noticed that on the Mauritius page the contrast between background image and text caused reading issues.
This was resolved by darking the background image.
2. Navbar
- Page inspected on mobile devices using dev tool
- Toggle button pressed to inspect if dropdown menu is executed.
Under testing it was noticed that dropdown menu was behind images. Issue resolved using z-index and changing background colour
of dropdrown menu only on smaller devices.
3. Contact-form
- Go to the "Contact Us" page
- Submit query was pressed with empty fields. "Please fill out field" returned appears.
- Invalid email format inserted. Message related to invalid email format appears.
It was also noticed that contact form width was too small on smaller devices. This was modified using 
@media screen to increase width to 90%.
4. Links 
All links tested on all pages.
Social links and download links initially changed active page. Issue resolved by adding style="_blank" attribute
